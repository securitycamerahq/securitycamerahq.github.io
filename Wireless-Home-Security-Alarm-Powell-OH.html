If there are no as-built documents supplying functionality and setup info to make this combination work, there are just two alternatives. The first alternative, which might be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial service provider is not available or unwilling to offer those details) and document the geography and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system.
