Generally, consumer-grade cameras are constructed to work well when there is plenty of readily available light, and once the lighting becomes low or missing (believe sunset or nighttime), their pedigree starts to reveal.

<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many alarm systems work the precise same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electric current.

If the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits, which indicates. If somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the alarm system.
