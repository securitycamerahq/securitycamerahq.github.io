<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal because the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
