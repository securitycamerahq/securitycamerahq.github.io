<p>After we used the Anker EufyCam for nearly six months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to provide on its pledge of as much as one year of battery life. What we don't love is that it leaves spaces in between recordings, which varied anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending on the settings. We have seen some improvements since the camera's launch, and will continue to upgrade this evaluation and evaluate, as required.</p>

<p>On the surface area, these 2 camera categories may appear similar, though if you were able to see inside, the differences become distinct and apparent. Commercial-grade cameras are created and constructed for high-performance applications where failure is not an option; consumer-grade cameras are not. Usually, consumer-grade cameras are developed to work well when there is plenty of readily available light, and once the lighting ends up being low or absent (think sunset or nighttime), their pedigree starts to show. Since they have bigger internal video sensing units and higher-quality elements that can adjust and capture excellent low light video, commercial cameras surpass their cheaper cousins.</p>
<p>However, convenience does not always feature included security. If you do not do it right, going from wired to wireless security indicates possibly exposing yourself to outside attacks. You don't need to get in a house to cut the wire with wireless," the way you would with wired security, warns Du. Without taking the correct security precautions, you could be leaving your home available to burglars who can jam your system and enter your home without your sensors picking up their presence.</p>

Think about asking neighbors for suggestions on security systems too. They may even suggest a local company with a strong reputation that can expertly install the equipment.</p>
