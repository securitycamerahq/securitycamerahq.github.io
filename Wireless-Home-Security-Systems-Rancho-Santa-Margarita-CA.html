But neither can tape-record continually, and they both need the Ring Secure strategy to catch recordings. Also, the wired variation usually left spaces of up to 7 seconds in between 1-minute recordings, while the battery version left about a minute in between 30-second clips. Both likewise lack person detection and geofencing, which other cameras utilize to cut down on incorrect signals.</p>
<p>A system that requires a contract may be a clever option for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?
