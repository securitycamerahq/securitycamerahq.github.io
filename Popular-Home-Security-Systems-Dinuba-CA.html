<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize people the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
