<p>One important exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 each month, which might be a cost effective alternative for customers in rural areas. We suggest cellular systems due to the fact that they're a lot more secure than landline systems, but there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't readily available. If you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still better than no security at all.</p>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see in the evening. If catching video footage in the dark is a priority, make sure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
