Through the mobile app, you can stream live video of your home or perhaps utilize two-way audio to interact with others. If Piper spots motion or sound, it will inform you through text, push phone, notification, or email call. In fact, you can even utilize all four approaches at the same time.</p>

Some systems keep tape-recorded video locally on an SD card or a strong state drive, while others provide cloud storage. Locally saved video is a good choice for do-it-yourselfers on a budget plan, but you need to beware not to overwrite video you may need later on. Cloud storage makes it easy to shop and access recorded video, but it can cost hundreds of dollars annually depending upon your subscription. Some systems use both cloud storage and local storage, and some offer a dedicated storage drive that offers you DVR capabilities with time-lapse recording, that makes it simple to find a video event that took place at a particular time.</p>

<p>For these different systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single user interface, an in-depth knowledge of all the required systems is needed. There are only two choices if there are no as-built documents offering performance and setup information to make this combination work. The first choice, which might be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original service provider is not available or reluctant to supply those information) and document the topology and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other approach is to rip and replace, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to assemble them all.</p>
<p>Likewise called eyeball" cameras, the turret camera has a ball-and-socket joint to let you exactly redirect the field of view without remounting the security camera whenever. They're terrific for storage facilities. A few of these may look like dome cameras, but there's a basic technique to differentiate them - if the lens and the IR LEDs remain in front of the glass on the real estate instead of consisted of behind it, you've got a turret camera instead of a dome.</p>
<p>We attempted each of the cameras in numerous locations around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we checked each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) along with an Android smart device (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint provides a variety of equipment and home automation products at a reasonable rate, the one area where the company particularly stands out is in DIY installation. </p>
