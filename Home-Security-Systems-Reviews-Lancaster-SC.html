<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. The clever bit is that the camera not just identifies that individuals have actually entered its 130-degree field of view, however it will also have a stab at acknowledging them too.

<p>Despite having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its restricted, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can secure that plug and include another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension package, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This suggests the Circle 2 winds up being more costly general per unit than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we don't suggest it considering that its battery-saving routines can disrupt performance.</p>
