<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first noticed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it rapidly ended up being a staff (and friends and family) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send out signals, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

However, there were some issues with linking the command hub to our tester's network. </p>
