<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the obligation of the whole community. Home protection is a major issue for homeowners throughout the nation, but homeowners of every capability can take proactive procedures to protect their homes.

<p>A system that needs an agreement might be a clever option for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?

We have actually seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year contracts!
