<p>If you do encounter a home invasion emergency situation, you can set off the 80dB alarm. I am somewhat disappointed by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas numerous other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB and even 105dB. Despite that, the alarm should be enough to scare away burglars in most cases. To hold and recoup costs alarm companies liable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company must be accredited, pay any registration or incorrect alarm costs, and offer physical evidence like camera video or a damaged window to require authorities reaction.</p>
