<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas.

As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
