<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature.

In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal considering that the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
