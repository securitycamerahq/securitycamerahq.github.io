The image is clear and sharp and I saw very little lag in between my actions and the image showed on the app. I 'd certainly state it's one of the much better cameras in terms of video quality.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers recognize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
