<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are 3 times more likely to be robbed. Brinks owns and operates its own US-based monitoring center. Its monitoring service includes an advantage called ASAPer, which simultaneously messages a group of pre-set contacts to figure out whether alarm activity is a real emergency or incorrect alarm. The majority of monitoring center call household members one at a time, which can slow response times.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively typical. If a homeowner forgets their secrets and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is activated by a neighborhood cat, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a property owner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>
