<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complex than it must be. Recordings, notifies, and combination all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month.

The main difference is that the wired system pairs with the other wise home gadgets to produce a network of home security around your home. It can be controlled remotely through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile phone or through the control board (also referred to as the alarm panel).
