<p>Ring may not be the most advanced system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), but it sure has actually acquired rather the excitement over the years. We've been evaluating Ring Alarm quite a bit lately, and we really like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a packaged security kit that uses basic intrusion protection with super-low month-to-month monitoring fees. Or ... no monitoring fees at all if you pick the free self-monitor" choice.</p>

Many sites requiring alarm installations no longer have conventional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with traditional telephone dialer ability do not work reliably over some types of VoIP service.</p>
